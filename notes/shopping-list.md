## Priority Order (Buy Sequence)

1. **AI Server remaining parts** — 32GB DDR4 DIMM, NVMe, Thermaltake Tower 300 (~€280-305)
2. **Main PC PSU + riser** — be quiet! Straight Power 12 750W + PCIe riser cable (~€160-180); sell CX600
3. **NAS build** — N100 board, Jonsbo N2, SF750 Platinum 2024, 1-2TB NVMe (~€400-600)

Steps 1 and 2 are independent (AI server gets its own PSU). Step 3 can wait for deals on the N100 board.
